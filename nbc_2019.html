<p>CNBC: If you're hearing the message from the market, I guess the question is are you listening in the sense that you went ahead and raised rates on Wednesday? How do you justify that if you are indeed listening to the market and investors who re putting their money on the line have decided that there's not much inflation concern in my purchases of fixed income bonds? I'm looking for safety in fixed income, I'm going away from stocks. I don't see the robust economy you guys do. How c o you justify the rate increase if indeed you're listening to the message of the market?</p>
<p>John Williams: Well, we're listening to the message of the market, but we're also looking carefully at the data and also talking to business and other leaders in the communities around the country and trying to incorporate all that informatio together to get a view of the economy. As I said, we have a very strong economy. We have about 3 percent growth this year is what we expect. Unemployment is at near 50 years lows, and again, we expect this economy, although have a somewhat slo er growth next year, but still very solid growth and good, solid job gains.</p>
<p>CNBC: But importantly, we are listening to the - there are risks to that outlook. There is clearly some concerns that maybe the economy will slow further, and we are sitting there not sitting there thinking what we actually know for sure what's going to happen. What we're going to be doing coming into next year and through next year is reassessing our views of the economy. Listening to not only markets but everybody that we talk to look at all the data and be ready to reassess and re
-evaluate our views and obviously reassess and re-evaluate our policy stance.</p>
<p>John Williams: After saying that you were concerned, considering further guide, not providing further guidance. The statement still says some further rate hikes. So how data dependent are you really if your statement already tells us you're sti
11 going up?</p>
<p>CNBC: Well, I'd make a couple comments about that. First of all, we made some changes. Important changes to our statement around that one is we change the word from expects further gradual increases to judges. Now if you look at it up in the di
ctionary, judges means is that you know we've made an opinion.</p>
<p>John Willians: It's our judgment or opinion. That's where we see things going. This is not a commitment or promise or in any way a sense that we know for sure that that's what we're going to do. We're actually saying pretty clearly this is how we see it now based on our positive pretty optimistic view of the economy, and we're we'll change that as needed.</p>
<p>CNBC: The word "some" in front of the gradual increases, which is indicating that although we're not, we don't think that we're totally done raising rates, we've made a lot of progress in getting interest rates back to normal.</p>
<p>John Williams: Finally, we did add this sentence, which I think is really important, is that the committee is monitoring and continues to monitor global economic and financial market developments and their impact, potential impact on the econo ic outlook. So when we add a sentence like that, that's not just that that has meaning, it's indicating to everybody that we're very focused on that and very attuned to the possibility that this outlook may change in coming months and we're go ng to be very focused on studying that and open to reassessing our views.</p>
