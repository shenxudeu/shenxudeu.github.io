# Hello World, This is Shen

This is Shen. The name, in Chinese character, is ç”³, which is the archaic, alternative name of Shanghai the city. No surprise, I was born in Shanghai, hence the name. 

I rarely write. When I do, it's either very technical or practical.

And you may find grammer mistakes in my English here and there.

But um, bear with me, if you will?
