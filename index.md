# Hello World, This is Shen


This is Shen. The name, in Chinese character, is ç”³, which is the archaic, alternative name of Shanghai the city. No surprise, I was born in Shanghai, hence the name. 

I rarely write. When I do, it's often criticized (by none other than my wife) as either too technical or too practical. I think I've written less articles than code comments (even those I wrote very little and very poorly). And neither of them were ever poetic or funny.

And you may find grammer mistakes in my English here and there.

But um, bear with me, if you will?
