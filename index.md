# Welcome to Shen's Blog


This is Shen. 

The name, in Chinese character, is ç”³, which is the archaic, alternative name of Shanghai the city. No surprise, I was born in Shanghai, hence the name. I work in quantitative finance, try to understand market behaviors through data.

The purpose of this blog: explaining complex concepts by plain words, and most importantly, codes.

I rarely write. When I do, it's often criticized (by none other than my wife) as either too technical or too practical. I will try to make them reader-friendly but it can be a long way before getting poetic or entertaining.  

And you may find grammer mistakes in my English here and there.

But um, bear with me, if you sole purpose, as mine, is to learn some science?
